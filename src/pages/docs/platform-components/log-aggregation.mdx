# Log Aggregation: Gigapipe

[Gigapipe](https://gigapipe.com/index.html) is a Loki compatible log (and metrics) aggregation system using [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) under the hood. [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail) is used to feed logs into `qryn`. Finally we configure Grafana from our [Monitoring](/platform-components/monitoring) stack to use `qryn` as a data source.

Documentation: https://gigapipe.com/docs/oss.html

Note: Gigapipe was previously called Qryn, this documentation was originally written for qryn but has been updated to reflect the new name.

## Architecture Decision Record

### Pros

- Simple monolithic architecture (gigapipe HTTP server + ClickHouse as data store)
- Fully Loki / LogQL compatible
- Also supports other data sources (we don't make use of this currently)
- ClickHouse as a backend equals excellent performance and scalability
- ClickHouse can be configured to use S3 for storage for increased durability and "bottomless" storage

### Cons

- Requires extra configuration for ClickHouse
- Not as widely used as Loki

### Alternatives Considered

#### Loki

At Mynewsdesk we use Loki for our in house version of the platform. It has served us quite well but architecturally it has significantly more moving parts than Qryn which means it becomes harder to reason about. It's also dependent on S3 if running in it's "scalable" mode which makes it harder to create a good "it just works" experience for our open source platform.

## Usage

You can tail logs from applications via `k logs <application-name>`. You can also filter the logs based on type of deployment by passing the types as additional arguments to the command. Eg. `k logs <application-name> web sidekiq`.

To do advanced search, filtering and aggregation of logs, you can use the Explore view in Grafana and selecting the Logging datasource. Run `k logs:search <application-name>` to quickly open the Grafana log UI for a specific application.
