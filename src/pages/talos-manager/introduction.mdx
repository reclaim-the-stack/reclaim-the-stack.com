# Talos Manager: Introduction

[Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) is our recommended OS for running Kubernetes. It's a minimal Linux distribution that is designed to run Kubernetes and nothing else. It's built from the ground up to be secure, immutable, and stateless and works great on bare metal as well as on cloud.

[Talos Manager](https://github.com/reclaim-the-stack/talos-manager) is a web application we built to manage Talos Linux server bootstrapping on Hetzner Cloud and Hetzner Dedicated Servers. It leverages Talos's ability to bootstrap from a remote URL, and provides a web interface to manage the process.
